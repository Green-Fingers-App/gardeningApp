# Testing Strategy – From Unit to E2E

This week, we deep-dived into the topic of software testing and started building our **GreenFingers test strategy** based on the Rational Unified Process (RUP). With that, we now have a structured approach for verifying the quality and functionality of our application at multiple levels.

Our app is growing – from user management and garden creation to future features like IoT integration. So testing early and often is key to staying confident in our code.

## What We're Testing

We’ve identified several test levels, based on both our tech stack and testing goals:

| Layer        | Tool(s)                      | Purpose                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend** | Jest + React Testing Library | Test UI components and form behavior from a user’s view |
| **Backend**  | Jest                         | Unit testing business logic and route handlers          |
| **API**      | Postman                      | Manual and automated testing of REST endpoints          |
| **E2E**      | Maestro                      | Behavior-driven full-app flows for login, signup, etc.  |

We started implementing **unit tests for our login flow** using Jest and React Testing Library. Here's a sneak peek at our passing test suite for `login.tsx`:

We also implementing **unit tests for our authentication logic** in our backend side. The unit tests in auth.test.js focus on verifying the behavior of the auth controller functions (login, signup, and jsonrefresh) in controllers/auth.js.

The tests use Jest to mock dependencies (authModel, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken, pg), isolating controller logic and simulating database, password hashing, and token operations to validate correct responses and error handling.

You can check our [**auth.test.js**](https://github.com/DHBW-Malte/gardeningApp-backend/blob/main/__tests__/auth.test.js).

## First Tests in Action

To test our login form, we focused on:

- Rendering basic elements
- Validating input (email and password)
- Verifying that the login function is called with correct values

Here you can checkout our [**LoginForm.test.tsx**](https://github.com/DHBW-Malte/gardeningApp/blob/main/green-fingers/_tests_/LoginForm.test.tsx).

And yes, that test is now green!

We also used the implemented **test coverage** function from **Jest** to check our first unit test:

## What's Next?

We're currently working on our [**RUP-based Test Plan**](https://github.com/DHBW-Malte/gardeningApp/blob/main/green-fingers/docs/RUPTestPlan.md), which defines:

- Test motivation and strategy
- Targeted components and workflows
- Entry/exit criteria for test cycles
- Environmental setup and responsibilities

Once finalized, this plan will guide all our future testing efforts – from microcontroller integration to database edge-case testing.

We’ll also explore using **Maestro** for end-to-end mobile UI tests, so we can simulate real user behavior in our React Native app. Here is our E2E test, which covers the login, garden creation and plant creation.

## Summary

By formalizing our test approach now, we’re setting up GreenFingers for long-term stability. Our CI/CD pipeline will soon run these tests on every push to `main`, helping us catch bugs early and ship with confidence.

We’ll keep you updated on how this test strategy evolves — especially as we bring in sensors and hardware!

Thanks for reading
Stay tuned for our next milestone!
