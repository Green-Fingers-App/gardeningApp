## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) provides a comprehensive description of the specifications for the "Green Fingers" application. It aims to assist gardeners in tracking plant care through features like adding plants, managing watering schedules, receiving notifications, and integrating sensor data. This document details the planned features, functionality, and boundary conditions for the development of the app.

### 1.2 Scope

The app will be developed for both Android and iOS (via Flutter).

Actors of this app include:

- Users: Gardeners who will use the app to track their plants and care schedules.
- Admins: Admins responsible for maintaining plant databases and overseeing app content.

The main subsystems include:

- Plant Database:  
  Store and manage detailed information about plants (e.g., watering frequency, temperature, sunlight requirements).
- User Account System:
  Users will create accounts to store gardens and plant data.
- Notifications System:  
  Notify users when they need to water or take care of their plants.
- Search System:
  Allow users to search for plants based on various parameters like water needs, sunlight, or season.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Vision

Our vision is to provide a comprehensive gardening solution that seamlessly integrates software and hardware tools to empower users in managing both indoor and outdoor gardens. With a focus on automation and smart features, we offer real-time weather updates, UV lighting sensors, moisture tracking, and a solar-powered watering system, ensuring optimal plant care.

We aim to guide users with tailored advice on watering, nutrition, sunlight, and harvest timing, along with insights into edible plant parts. Personalized notifications keep users informed of their plants’ needs, enhancing their gardening experience.

By offering efficient garden management tools—including pumps, tubing, and nozzles—and software that suggests plants based on location, provides plant calendars, and sends notifications, our goal is to simplify and streamline gardening. We empower users to feel confident and in command of their gardens, making the process smarter, more efficient, and more enjoyable through real-time insights and automation.
